  # When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
  # application and reports this data to the New Relic service at
  # newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for each
  # environment below. (formerly called 'enabled')
  monitor_mode: true

  # Developer mode should be off in every environment but
  # development as it has very high overhead in memory.
  developer_mode: false

  # The newrelic agent generates its own log file to keep its logging
  # information separate from that of your application. Specify its
  # log level here.
  log_level: info

  # Optionally set the path to the log file This is expanded from the
  # root directory (may be relative or absolute, e.g. 'log/' or
  # '/var/log/') The agent will attempt to create this directory if it
  # does not exist.
  # log_file_path: 'log'

  # Optionally set the name of the log file, defaults to 'newrelic_agent.log'
  # log_file_name: 'newrelic_agent.log'

  # The newrelic agent communicates with the service via https by default.  This
  # prevents eavesdropping on the performance metrics transmitted by the agent.
  # The encryption required by SSL introduces a nominal amount of CPU overhead,
  # which is performed asynchronously in a background thread.  If you'd prefer
  # to send your metrics over http uncomment the following line.
  # ssl: false

  #============================== Browser Monitoring ===============================
  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:
      # By default the agent automatically injects the monitoring JavaScript
      # into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.
      auto_instrument: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the New Relic server.
  #
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings
  # are optional. Default port is 8080.

  # proxy_port: 8080

  # The agent can optionally log all data it sends to New Relic servers to a
  # separate log file for human inspection and auditing purposes. To enable this
  # feature, change 'enabled' below to true.
  # See: https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/audit-log
  audit_log:
    enabled: false

  # Tells transaction tracer and error collector (when enabled)
  # whether or not to capture HTTP params.  When true, frameworks can
  # exclude HTTP parameters from being captured.
  # Rails: the RoR filter_parameter_logging excludes parameters
  # Java: create a config setting called "ignored_params" and set it to
  #     a comma separated list of HTTP parameter names.
  #     ex: ignored_params: credit_card, ssn, password
  capture_params: false

  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the New Relic service once a
  # minute. Included in the transaction is the exact call sequence of
  # the transactions including any SQL statements issued.
  transaction_tracer:

    # Transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to
    # turn it off. This feature is only available at the Professional
    # and above product levels.
    enabled: true

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction
    # trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds
    # this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to
    # New Relic. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f",
    # which will use the threshold for an dissatisfying Apdex
    # controller action - four times the Apdex T value.
    transaction_threshold: apdex_f

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be
    # recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no
    # SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its original form,
    # and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals.
    record_sql: obfuscated

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL
    # call. In other words, when SQL statements exceed this threshold,
    # then capture and send to New Relic the current stack trace. This is
    # helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from.
    stack_trace_threshold: 0.500

    # Determines whether the agent will capture query plans for slow
    # SQL queries.  Only supported in mysql and postgres.  Should be
    # set to false when using other adapters.
    # explain_enabled: true

    # Threshold for query execution time below which query plans will
    # not be captured.  Relevant only when `explain_enabled` is true.
    # explain_threshold: 0.5

  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and
  # sends them to New Relic for viewing
  error_collector:

    # Error collector is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn
    # it off. This feature is only available at the Professional and above
    # product levels.
    enabled: true

    # To stop specific errors from reporting to New Relic, set this property
    # to comma-separated values.  Default is to ignore routing errors,
    # which are how 404's get triggered.
    ignore_errors: "ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound"

  # If you're interested in capturing memcache keys as though they
  # were SQL uncomment this flag. Note that this does increase
  # overhead slightly on every memcached call, and can have security
  # implications if your memcached keys are sensitive
  # capture_memcache_keys: true

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# For Rails applications, RAILS_ENV is used to determine the environment.
# For Java applications, pass -Dnewrelic.environment <environment> to set
# the environment.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic configuration settings for these environments here.
