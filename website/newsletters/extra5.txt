Subject: Public Whip Extra #5 - Terror law voting record in full

As a special treat, we've put up today's divisions in parliament a day
earlier than usual. Here is the the voting record of the government's
defeat.
    http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2005-11-09&number=84

You can see there were 49 Labour rebels who voted against the
government, and one Tory rebel (Peter Tapsell) who voted with the
government. Click "All possible voters" to find out who was absent 
(probably deliberately abstaining).

And read the debate here.

This is made possible by "Today in the Commons", a new service from
Hansard. Before, parliamentary debates were only published online at
8am the next working day. Now they appear the same day. Thanks to the
hard working clerks!

Note that all this is experimental. It's new that parliament does this
at all, and our code for processing it is also new. Hopefully soon
Public Whip will update automatically with new divisions shortly after
they happen.
