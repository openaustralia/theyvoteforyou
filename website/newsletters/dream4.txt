Hello Dream MP,

Somehow we've managed to complete large amounts of hacking
on the website whilst everyone has been changing the data,
and somehow it's *not* all gone belly-up in the process.
This is unusual in our experience.

There are many new features which we don't need to announce
right now.  We do, however, need to announce that the way
you change a policy vote (formerly known as Dream MP) has
altered.

We've thrown away that useful side-bar chart of all the
policies you could vote for.  Now you need to go to the page
of the particular policy, then click on one of the selected
divisions, which then takes you to a page where you can
change a vote (a little drop-down box above the motion text,
if you are logged in).

To add a new vote rather than change one that is already there, 
you have to click the "Every division" link near the top of
the page, then select which division (from the thousands)
you want to make the policy vote in.

An example of such a page is

We hope to improve this interface a little in due course.

In the meantime, feel free to make use of the Forum for any
gripes, praises, whatever.  It's useful if we can all see
the problems and queries being encountered.

Also, please, please, when you edit motion text, can you add
in as many links as you can, particularly to the Bills and
legislation that is being amended.  This should be easy to
do if you are actually doing your homework properly.
