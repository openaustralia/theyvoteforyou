Subject: Public Whip Dream MPs - Couldn't motion text be clearer?

***********************************************************************
**Discussion Forum**

This is an email to all DMPs (Dream Members of Parliament). 

The virtual Commons tea room for Dream MPs, serving Dream tea, wine, 
spirits and other insubstantial refreshments, is now open for business.  

http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=1

Pop in and say hello! Ask questions, say what's on your mind, meet the other
Dream MPs. Please email us team@publicwhip.org.uk if you're having any trouble
using the forum.

Meanwhile, back in your virtual offices where you plan your voting strategy
without a party whip to tell you what to do, may we draw your attention to... 


**Motion Text Editing**

Since we lack the staff (Clerks of the House, Legal advisors, and so forth),
it would be wise if we all shared our briefing papers.  

I am sure you are all doing the proper research before you vote in each
division -- finding what it is, what it means, and maybe even checking the
text of the legislation that is to be amended. We'd like you to share this
work.  

You will have noticed our disclaimer above the motion text that we do produce:
"Procedural text extracted from the debate... for guidance only, irrelevant
text may be shown, crucial text may be missing.", as well as the fact that it
is nearly always wrong, garbled, and generally screwed up in a way that only
computers can manage.

To overcome this, we have included a new feature where you, as a logged-in
dream MP, can edit and correct the motion text that we publish using a simple
system called a "wiki". (If you are not familiar with what this internet
technology is, check out the "wiki" encyclopedia http://www.wikipedia.org )

Basically, there is a link at the bottom of the motion text which says, "edit
and correct this motion". Following it will take you to a page where you can
edit and save it. We've done 30 recent divisions already to give you an idea
of how the results could look.

If you know of a more user-friendly style of wording, feel free to discuss it
and put it straight in.

The idea is to make it as accurate, authorative, brief, and as jargon-free as
possible so that new readers who don't know Parliamentary procedure can gain
enlightenment.  You are encouraged to include hyperlinks to the statutory
legislation, command papers, reports, and committee proceedings that are
referred to so that readers who want to follow the story further will know
where to look.

You can write comments, but please keep them below the "Comments" line so that
they don't interfere with the provision of what we hope could be the most
authoratitive and accessible record of what has been going on in the real
Parliament since the last election.

The aim is to get enough of this done in time for the election that it is
worth ordinary voters having a look-in to find out what's actually been going
on there these past four years.  

We look forward to discussing these crazy ideas on the forum as things get
going.
