Subject: Public Whip Newsletter #10 - Lords a Whipping!

Welcome to the tenth Public Whip newsletter.

Inside this issue:
* Editorial: "Ooops!"
* Site Updates: "House of Lords"
* Site Updates: "Division Information"
* News

The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk ) is a project to
data-mine the record of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, so
that you can hold them to account.

Editorial 

Recently, due to a combination of accident and laziness, all our
new work went up onto the main website instead of the staging area. 

This ruined our plans of having a proper launch party in an
expensive room in the Palace of Westminster with free drinks,
canapes, small-talk and all that useful networking when we put
online the table of Lords' votes for the public to see for the
first time. 

Oh well. We couldn't have afforded it anyway. I guess that's
because we haven't got any adverts. 

As always, the forum ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/forum ) is open
for chatting. We'll be continuing to tweak and improve the site over 
the coming months, unless the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 
( http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-2049791,00.html )
renders all this work pointless. 

In the meantime, enjoy it while you can!

 - Julian, The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk )

House of Lords

Yes, it's up there. All the votes in the second chamber back to the 
general election of May 2005, interleaved with the votes in the Commons. 
There's a drop-down box in the banner of the 'division' page should you 
wish to see the votes of only one chamber at a time. Everything is 
seamlessly integrated(tm) across all features. That means we track 
the record right across the boundary when an MP gets elevated 
into the upper chamber

Some brave people have even filled in the Policy votes across the two houses, 
so the whipping doesn't stop just because the member has changed seat:

We'll push the data back in time as far as it goes once we finish 
correcting all the typos.

Division Information

The division page has grown an extra column, the 'majority' on each vote. 
But that's not all. Now you can break the voting down per party in 
each House. Simply select the Parliamentary term, the house, and the party, 
and see the numbers that are ordinary hidden behind other numbers. 

We put this in because we noticed that the Conservative party often 
had suspiciously low turn-outs in their votes, and wondered whether 
there was such a thing as whipping for an abstention. See the 
bottom of the table at:

Those looking for clues what the actress said should look no further than:

News

An article and leader in The Times claims that MPs, worried about
their rankings on TheyWorkForYou, are trying to rig them.
They're making extra interventions in debates, and tabling
excessive written questions. We were sceptical at first, but all
the MP researchers and party insiders that we talked to had seen
some strange goings on. Let us know if you have.

Here are two articles which describe how the party whips (and not
the Public Whip!) behave to get their wicked way with MPs.  The
Telegraph also calls for withdrawal of taxpayer-paid salaries for
whips, a policy Public Whip supports. Well, unless they start
paying us as well!

Meanwhile, signs of the number of people using Public Whip bubble
up into the media. Here it's used by a Guardian journalist to
examine George Galloway's attendance record, and by a local MP
writing a letter to the Cambridge Evening News to explain his
voting record on the new smoking laws.

Philip Cowley, of Nottingham University, has a new book "The
Rebels", a detailed analysis of rebellion in the 2001-2005
parliament. Here Julian reviews it, with follow up by Philip
Cowley.

And there's more discussion about Julian's review of the
previous book "Revolts and Rebellions".
