The results of yesterday's Higher Education Bill vote are now available on the
Public Whip website.  For a full list of voters, scroll down the page.  Rebels
are highlighted in red.  Why not see how your MP voted?

There were 315 votes for the motion, 310 votes against, and one person (David
Taylor, North West Leicestershire) who voted for both.  Altogether, including
one Tory (Robert Jackson), there were 73 MPs who voted against their party
whip.  You can see a list of just the rebels here.

In the abstain column of the "Party Summary" table you can also see that
relatively fewer Labour MP's voted than is normal for a division.
