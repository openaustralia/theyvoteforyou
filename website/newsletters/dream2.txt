Subject: Public Whip Dream MP masterclass - Tuesday 17th April

Hello Dream MP,

Interested in parliament and/or campaigning?  Next Tuesday, 17th April
2005 from 6pm in London, Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/ )
are hosting a Dream MP masterclass.  

You should come along if you...
... care passionately about the law passed on a particular subject
... are doing any sort of campaigning
... are interested in new ways of using the internet for political engagement
... just want to work out what on earth your MP is up to...

We're going to teach each other how to work out what each division
in the UK parliament means.  What is the actual effect of each MPs
vote?  We'll be learning how to use Public Whip website's tools to
share our understanding of this with each other.  Think of it as "open
source" parliamentary campaigning.

Julian Todd from Public Whip will be running the session.  We'll be
concentrating mainly on "motion text editing".  That is, creating a
clear, plain English (compared to parliamentary procedural speak!)
description of what a division in parliament means.  We'll also be
making Dream MPs - selections of votes by a particular issue (e.g.
Global Warming) that you care about.  The Dream MPs can be used to
rank real MPs as to how well they voted on the issue.

Our venue is James Cronin's house (near the British Library / Euston).
For more details, send me an email, or look at the following web page.
You can also ask questions and make comments by editing the web page

The Public Whip
