<p><b>What is this all about software patents?</b>  
<i>Imagine that someone owned a patent giving them the exlusive right to know
How to make a piece of toast, or how to lock a front door. Everytime you did
one of these simple actions, you risk being sued and forced to pay huge damages
for patent violation.</i>

<p><i>Imagine that someone owned a patent giving them the exlusive right to know
how to make a piece of toast, or how to lock a front door. Everytime you did
one of these simple actions, you risk being sued and forced to pay huge damages
for patent violation.

In the world of software developers, this absurd situation is about to
become a reality.</i>

<p><b>The Public Whip is threatened by a proposed EU software patents
directive</b>.  Many software patents are passed even though the "inventions"
are obvious to anyone who can program, and even when there is prior art.  The
EU directive will stifle innovation in software and destroy businesses.
Organisations will no longer own the software that they write.  Instead
some corporations will collect trivial patents and charge for them, while doing no
useful work.

<p><b>On 17-18 May, the Irish Presidency is attempting to push through the
software patents directive at a meeting of ministers.</b>  Last September, the European
Parliament voted for a much better version of the directive.  The Council of
Ministers is due to overrule the democratic decision of the Parliament. 
They are about to pass the much worse form of the directive.

<p><b>The Public Whip and many other websites are suspending service
for the duration of this decision period.</b>

<p><b>Please act now to save The Public Whip and other cool software</b>

<p>
<ul>

<li>If you are <b>an MP</b> or know some, contact Patricia Hewitt or others in
the DTI and ask them to change Britain's vote in the Council of Ministers to be
against the counter-proposal.  Lord Sainsbury of Turville is the minister
probably going to the concil meeting.  Jacqui Smith MP sometimes deputises for
him, and would go if Lord Sainsbury was unable to.

<li>If you are <b>a voter</b>, <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com">Fax Your MP</a> (free!) or talk to your MP. Tell your MP to talk to Patricia Hewitt and ask her to change Britain's vote.

<li>Media queries, please ring:

<p>The Public Whip is a project to watch Members of the United Kingdom
Parliament, so that the public (people like us) can better influence their
voting patterns.
