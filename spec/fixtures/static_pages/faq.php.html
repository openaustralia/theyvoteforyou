<a name="division">What is a division?</a>
</h2>
<p>
A division is a formal vote on a motion in the House of
Representatives or the Senate. A motion is a formal proposal put to
the House or Senate to take action of some kind.
</p>
<p>
When a division is called on a particular motion, Members of
Parliament (MPs) in the House of Representatives or Senators in the
Senate divide themselves into two groups: one that votes Aye (yes)
and one that votes No. Each political party has whips who try to
persuade their members to vote along party lines.
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="division-occur">
When does a division
occur?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
Most decisions in Parliament are made
<a href="http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html">
‘on
the voices’
</a>
and not by division. When a question is asked by
the Chair, the Members of Parliament (MPs) or Senators call out Aye
(yes) or No and the Chair decides which are in the majority without
recording the names of who voted and how they voted.
</p>
<p>
A division is only called if two or more MPs or Senators call
for one. If only one MP or Senator calls for a division then their
name may be recorded in the official record (the Hansard) but no
division will occur.
</p>
<p>
In the House of Representatives, if there are four or less MPs
on a side of the division then the division does not proceed and
the Speaker declares the decision of the House immediately.
However, the names of the MPs in the minority are recorded.
</p>
<p>
In the Senate, if there is only one Senator on a side of the
division then the division does not proceed and the President
declares the decision of the Senate immediately. However, the names
of the lone Senator may be recorded.
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="decisions">
Why don’t all decisions made
in Parliament appear on Public Whip?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
Public Whip is concerned with the voting patterns of
politicians, which means it is limited to formal votes (known as
divisions, see
<a href="#division">What is a division?</a>).
This
is because politicians’ names and how they voted are only recorded
in the official record of Parliament (known as the Hansard) when a
division occurs.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, most decisions in Parliament are not made by
division (see <a href="#division-occur">When does a division occur?</a>)
and so do not appear on this site.
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="summaries">
Why don’t all the divisions
have edited summaries?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
When you click on a link for a <a href="/divisions">division</a>,
you will be taken to a summary that
will either contain an edited description of the division or text
taken automatically from the official record of Parliament (known
as Hansard). In some cases, the summary will contain no text.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the divisions with edited summaries are those that
are relevant to one of the <a href="/policies">Policies</a>.
See our <a href="/help/research">Research</a>
page to find out more about how the summaries are edited.
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="policies">
What are Policies and how do
they work?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
On Public Whip, the <a href="/policies">Policies</a> are
sets of votes on an issue.
</p>
<p>
We choose and develop particular Policies for a number of
reasons. For example, we prioritise issues where politicians have
rebelled (e.g. the <a href="/policies/10">local government recognition divisions</a>)
or where parties have allowed their members to take a conscience vote
(e.g. the <a href="/policies/1">same sex marriage divisions</a>)
because these divisions give a strong indication of an individual politician’s voting patterns
(see <a href="#rebelandfree">What are “Rebel Voters” and what is a “Conscience Vote” or “Free Vote”?</a>).
Other reasons for selecting a particular Policy include whether the matter was an
election issue (e.g. the <a href="/policies/3">carbon price</a>) and whether
there was a high level of attendance
(see <a href="#clarify">What do the “attendance” and “rebellion” figures mean?</a>).
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Policies are restricted to issues that are voted
on by division because those are the only decisions that appear on Public Whip
(see <a href="#decisions">Why don’t all decisions made in Parliament appear on Public Whip?</a>)
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="rebelandfree">
What are “Rebel Voters” and
what is a “Conscience Vote” or “Free Vote”?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
An MP or Senator rebels by voting against the <a href="http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/party-whip.html">party whip</a>.
This is known as <a href="http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/crossing-the-floor.html">crossing the floor</a>   and rarely occurs these days.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote">conscience vote</a>
(also known as a free vote) occurs when MPs
or Senators are not obliged to vote with their party. Conscience votes
are rare. For example, between 1950 and 2007
<a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20#_Toc221347466">only 32 conscience votes</a>
took place. More recently in 2012 and 2013, the legislation related
to same sex marriage <a href="/policies/1">was decided by conscience vote</a>.
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="clarify">
What do the "attendance" and
"rebellion" figures mean?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
"Attendance" figures record the politicians who vote in
any given division.
</p>
<p>
There are several reasons why a politician may have low
attendance figures. For example, they may have abstained, have
ministerial or other duties or they may be the speaker. Currently,
the Public Whip does not record if a member spoke in the debate but
did not vote.
</p>
<p>
"Rebellion" figures record the number of rebel votes
(see <a href="#rebelandfree">What are “Rebel Voters” and what is a “Conscience Vote” or “Free Vote”?</a>).
</p>
<h2 class="faq">
<a name="tied-division">
What happens if a division is tied?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
In the House of Representatives, the Speaker
<a href="http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html">does not vote</a>
unless the result is a tie, in which case
<a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/~/link.aspx?_id=8485A681FB314882871407C0A81BE62C&amp;_z=z#thesp">the Speaker has the casting vote</a>
to decide the matter. Speakers are expected to cast their vote according to
a set of principles but these have not always been applied consistently (of course!).
</p>
<p>
There are also rare cases where the Speaker has not exercised a casting vote.
For example when a vote that
<a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/~/link.aspx?_id=9401351F60524BBF93050639FBA28300&amp;_z=z#abs">requires an absolute majority</a>
is tied, the Speaker’s casting vote may not acheive an absolute majority so there’s
no reason for them to excise that vote.
</p>
<p>
In the Senate, the President of the Senate may always vote along with other senators
so they do not have a casting vote. If a vote in the Senate is tied it is
<a href="http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html">considered to have failed</a>
because a majority vote has not been reached.
