<h1>Parliamentary Research</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Many people use Public Whip to research their area of special
interest and understand what Parliament is doing. We want to make
it possible for everyone to share the workload of decoding the
jargon and summarising the documents. Just being able to help one
another to find necessary information will be a major step
forward.
</p>
<h2>Commenting on debates</h2>
<p>
Over at
<a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>
(there is a
direct link from every division page) you can post your comments
against speeches in the Parliamentary debates. This is a good way
to highlight important facts or add information that may have been
left out of the official discussion.
</p>
<h2>Division description editing</h2>
<p>
When the system uploads a new Parliamentary division, it prints
the following statement above the words:
</p>
<blockquote>
Description automatically extracted from the debate,
please edit it to make it better.
</blockquote>
<p>
While
<a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>
helps to
make the debates more friendly, it doesn't make the motions more
readable, and our computer program often guesses it wrong. Not only
that, even when it gets it right, the accurate text uses too much
Parliamentary jargon and refers to other documents by page and line
number where it would better be served by a hyperlink. This is
particularly true for legislation.
</p>
<p>
Public Whip allows anyone to write a plain english version of
the motion, with links to explanations and relevant document.
</p>
<p>
We are looking for people who are passionate about issues in
Parliament that have been subject to frequent, repeated votes by
MPs. It could be immigration, education, the environment,
transport, international development, and so on. Find these
divisions, mark them with a Policy, and fix the division
descriptions so that other people can see the precise meaning of
what was voted upon. Public Whip is about making an informed choice
based on the definitive record, and not having to take anyone's
word for things.
</p>
<h2>Examples of division description editing</h2>
<p>
The first example is
<a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2005-03-02&amp;number=110">Council Tax - 2 Mar 2005 - Division No. 110</a>,
which is an
opposition motion. These have a simple structure, but even so
wording and formatting changes make the effect of the motion much
clearer. The crucial thing it that it should be easier to tell what
Aye and No mean.

That this House notes that council tax bills have increased by
70 per cent. under the Labour Government, with further
above-inflation rises planned in the forthcoming year and after the
general election; expresses concern that pensioners have been hit
hardest and calls on the Government to implement the Conservative
policy of an automatic council tax discount for those aged 65 and
over; notes with alarm the Government's plans in any third term for
a revaluation which would lead to greater inequities and new higher
council tax bands; rejects Liberal Democrat plans for a local
income tax, regional income tax and higher national income tax; and
calls for less bureaucracy and interference from Whitehall and
regional bureaucrats in local government funding and for greater
transparency in the allocation of local funding for councils.

council tax this year is set to be the lowest in over a decade at
around 4 per cent. and the second lowest since it was introduced

view that it will add less than £1 a week to average council tax

TODO: Give third example of legislative amendment vote.
</p>
<h2>Guidelines for editing the description of divisions</h2>
<ul class="motionguidelines">
<li>
Avoid Parliamentary jargon. Phrases like "Question Put", "I beg
to move", and "Third Reading" should not be used unless
explained.
</li>
<li>
Make it clear which side won the vote so people don't need to
read the numbers to discover the result. When they do look at the
vote chart after reading the division description, they should
already know what the Ayes and Noes mean.
</li>
<li>
Whenever there is an amendment to a motion, both the original
motion and the amended motion should be listed, never the amendment
which is meaningless on its own.
</li>
<li>
Include all possible hyper-links. Parliamentary motions can
mention Departmental Reports, Command Papers, UN resolutions, items
in the news, and past statements or votes in the House. Track
everything down using Google and make links to them so that people
who don't know these source documents exist can find them.
Political statements must at no time be more than one click away
from the facts that support or dispute it.
</li>
<li>
If there is a vote to pass a Statutory Instrument, link to the
Statutory Instrument and the Statute. Votes to change the
Parliamentary Standing Orders should link to both versions of the
Standing Order and provide an explanation and examples. However,
not every mention of a Standing Order needs to be linked if it's
the Speaker reading them out to justify what going to happen
next.
</li>
<li>
A division on a piece of legislation must have the full and
correct name of the Bill in the title followed by a dash "--" and
any further qualifiers: "Money Resolution", "Second Reading",
"Programme Motion", etc.
</li>
<li>
The reason for these qualifiers in a legislation division is to
put the vote in its place within the standard procedural plot.
Links to the next unit (eg the Standing Committee page) and the
preceding unit of the plot is also desirable.
</li>
<li>
You must endeavor to link to the correct version of the Bill.
There can be several and you must carefully examine the titles and
the dates to be sure to get them right. The links to them are often
broken, but the pages can be found by searching for the title in
quotes plus site:parliament.uk in Google.
</li>
<li>
When a clause or set of clauses are agreed to, link to them
directly and summarize their meaning if possible. Interpret the
meaning as best you can, and if you can't fully understand it, say
so. If a clause amends another Act that is online, then link
directly to that part of the Act that has been changed. In the
future we will be able to create back-links. The word "clause" and
"section" are sometimes used interchangeably.
</li>
<li>
Amendments to clauses are the hardest part of the job. You have
to read the top and the bottom of the debate relating to the
division very carefully. When the Speaker says: "With this it will
be convenient to discuss the following Amendments" he's telling you
the subject of the debate, not the meaning of the division. The
division only applies to what the MP said in the phrase: "I beg to
move". However, some of the amendments the speaker lists may need
to be considered because the amendment that was moved is incomplete
on its own. This is because each contiguous change in the text is a
separate amendment. It's sometimes possible to find a webpage
listing all the amendments.
</li>
<li>
Watch out for the phrase "Amendment by leave withdrawn" just
before the division is called, or you will put in the wrong text.
Sometimes the Speaker restates the amendment before or after the
division, but many times not. Watch out for negations: "That the
original words of the clause stand part" versus "That the amendment
be made."
</li>
<li>
Once you have started working through the votes on a Bill,
stick to it. It can take as long as an hour to piece together the
meaning of a division in the worst case. Fortunately, they don't
vote on the most boring parts of the Bill, so you don't need to
analyze them. However, it's a good idea to page through the full
text of a Bill to get a feel for its content. Once you get to know
it a little bit you'll be best placed to finish it off, so do
so.
</li>
<li>
As well as making the division description as clear, readable
and honest as possible so that people can decide how they feel
about the MPs who voted for or against it, leave it in a state that
gives those who want to do further research a head start. If you
spent an hour working out a motion, think of it as saving an hour
of someone else's time, which means they will be able to do
research that would otherwise not have been possible. For example,
newspaper reporters need to get to creditable facts quickly. You
may have given them a channel into the heart of the process which
means they don't have to rely on a self-serving Government press
notice to track down the news.
</li>
<li>
Division description editors are independent of Parliament,
which means we can be critical of its process in the way that
anyone in the system is unwilling or unable to be. But check up on
each other's work whenever you can.
</li>
<li>
We have experienced little use and no actual signs of abuse.
Until we experience abuse, we cannot make provisions for it. In
practice, wikis experience surprisingly little abuse, probably
because it's usually obvious and there are more people prepared to
erase the abuse than create it. There's always the chance that a
party may try to hijack this outlet as they do so many political
happening. However it's unlikely because it could too easily be
found out and backfire.
</li>
<li>
To prevent us (Francis and Julian) from abusing PublicWhip, we
have released all the code under the General Public License. We
would also like to establish a public repository for all the Policy
and Motion Text information so that we can't be accused of owning
the information. The safeguard is that anyone with the right skills
can download and establish a rival version of PublicWhip (under
another domain name) in case we get lazy, sell out, or run into
some sort of legal hassle. We must ensure that it can live on by
disabling our ability to abolish it.
