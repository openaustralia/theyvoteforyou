Division forum topics

On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Find for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Future
