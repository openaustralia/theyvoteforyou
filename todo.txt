On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Find for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Future
------

Search needs to search wiki text and Dream MP text

Make newsletter signing more streamlined

Sort out java applets, how to link to them. 

People add their web page URL to their profile and/or their Dream MP
(perhaps let HTML in Dream MP description)

User names need to link to profile page about that user

Forward/back division - show nearby divisions names

Tour somehow for first time users

Link to ideas.txt file

Change frontpage newsletter advert depending on whether you are logged in
(i.e. if you are already logged in and subscribed, we should advertise Dream MP
or something instead of the newsletter)
