But that division name doesn't account for wiki edits.

Code rewrite (pwaring)
----------------------

Fix all instances where code throws E_NOTICE errors or uses features
which are deprecated in PHP 5.3.x.

Move global variables into constants where possible - e.g. database
connection information.

Switch to a database abstraction library such as ADODB, and rewrite
all SQL queries to use bound parameters (e.g. SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?)

Change to a templating system, two options are:
Smarty - http://www.smarty.net
Twig - http://www.twig-project.org/

Change passwords to use something more secure than MD5, probably using
this library which uses salts and variable interactions:
