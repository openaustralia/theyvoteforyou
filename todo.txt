New division scraper:
--------------------

On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost
date=2003-03-14&number=114

answers2003-05-13
check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Dream MP
--------

"If the MPs rarely decisively vote on anything meaningful, we should not
apologize for it.  The deam MP exercise gets your optimistic
participation, and then you uncover the full horror that out of all this
apparent activity, there's fu*ck all happening.  It's only for show.
It's a disgrace."
- we need a discussion page for this, so people can work it out

"We can rate MPs on the basis of what they successfully get out through
written questions, because this is like science.  You don't become a respected
scientist or journalist by passing exams or getting the right jobs.  You do it
by advancing human knowledge, finding key facts out that are real interesting.
Then you get taken seriously.  Before then you're just a student."

Wrans

League table of how many didn't questions 

Print department
Match office (secretary of state...) to department?  Julian does this already
prob, check how it works and use it in all the tables, as it is useful at-a-glance
information.

uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.755W.4 - refers to uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-03.214W
which does actually exist, but crosses over two entire columns, so referencing the one in the middle doesn't pick it up.  Ooops.  Need some kind of ranging?
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.726W.0 - there is a phrase referring to debates, but the
link is given to wrans ;)
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.725W.2 - has a offrep which isn't there (as well
as two which we don't have indexed yet)
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-27.110W.2 - fails to find offrep

Back links to wrans that have referred to this one
Check all found URL links

Improve all MP name matching so no unknown ids
Make "unknown" name link a better page (rather than a meaningless error)

Some kind of "most inquisitive" on front page

Search for all questions that are about Hansard that you can now answer, and send off the answers.

Give help on how to request answers from hcinfo

Web site
--------

On konqueror on division page the "What is Tell?" etc. bar overlaps the Rebel
voters table in some cases. (On divisions with few voters / parties)

Popular pages today are...  Grep the logs somehow clever.

Tour somehow for first time users

FAQ needs to give more of an impression that we would like help

Link to ideas.txt file

Scraper
-------

Improve XML parser to be used for divisions.

House of Lords

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
get latest divisions, upload to db)

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Improve motion text / title extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing
    division.php?date=2003-09-16&number=313 - too much text [interruption]
    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307 - motion missed completely
    division.php?date=2001-01-22&number=71 - title is wrong!
    division.php?date=1997-07-07&number=42 - nothing of any use!
    division.php?date=2000-02-28&number=88 - too much text!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=321 - not deferred division!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=320 - not deferred division!
Add explanations
    division.php?date=2001-10-25&number=43 - multiple motions clearer,
also show initial motion in second vote, rather than hardly any text
