Finish rename of motion text editing (e.g. in project/ pages)

Make policy vote selection have drop down, show most recent 3 at top

Show divisions with the same beginning part of title in sidebar

Policy status - done vs. provisional

Stuff

On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost
date=2003-03-14&number=114

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Find for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Future
------

Policy aggregation function - generic version of election.php

Search needs to search division text and policy text and forum

Tour somehow for first time users

Preview on motion editing form, and policy editing
