Wrans

League table of how many didn't questions 

Print department
Match office (secretary of state...) to department?  Julian does this already
prob, check how it works and use it in all the tables, as it is useful at-a-glance
information.

uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.755W.4 - refers to uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-03.214W
which does actually exist, but crosses over two entire columns, so referencing the one in the middle doesn't pick it up.  Ooops.  Need some kind of ranging?
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.726W.0 - there is a phrase referring to debates, but the
link is given to wrans ;)
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.725W.2 - has a offrep which isn't there (as well
as two which we don't have indexed yet)
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-27.110W.2 - fails to find offrep

Give help on how to request answers from hcinfo

Web site

Popular pages today are...  Grep the logs somehow clever.

Tour somehow for first time users

FAQ needs to give more of an impression that we would like help

Scraper
-------

Improve XML parser to be used for divisions.

House of Lords

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
get latest divisions, upload to db)

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Improve motion text / title extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing
    division.php?date=2003-09-16&number=313 - too much text [interruption]
    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307 - motion missed completely
    division.php?date=2001-01-22&number=71 - title is wrong!
    division.php?date=1997-07-07&number=42 - nothing of any use!
    division.php?date=2000-02-28&number=88 - too much text!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=321 - not deferred division!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=320 - not deferred division!
Add explanations
    division.php?date=2001-10-25&number=43 - multiple motions clearer,
also show initial motion in second vote, rather than hardly any text
