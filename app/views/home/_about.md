### A Parliamentary Democracy for Everybody
In Australia, every 3 years or so, we all head to polling places across the country to elect individuals to represent us in Federal Parliament. They become Australia’s [Members of Parliament](/members) (MPs), and they’re there to advocate for the interests of the people who live in their electorate (whether we voted for them or not), vote on our behalf, and pass legislation to create a society which works for us.

### They vote for you
Between elections, how do you know that the individual speaking for you, in your electorate, votes in your interest? Have they ever voted against their party on an issue people like you in your electorate care about? Do they even turn up?

### How your MP votes on issues you care about
We’ve peeled back the layers of stuffy jargon, arcane procedures and language so you can find out whether a member voted on [expanding powers to intercept communications](/policies/44) or for [Aboriginal land rights](/policies/24). There is a whole [list of policies](/policies). If you see one missing, you can [add your own](<%= new_policy_path() %>).

### Find your MP
It’s easy to [get started by searching](/search) or head to the full list of [Representatives](/members/representatives) and  [Senators](/members/senate).

### Thanks for making this

<%= inline_project_name %> was built by the [OpenAustralia Foundation](https://www.oaf.org.au), an independent, non-partisan not-for-profit. It is based on the ground-breaking [UK Public Whip site](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/) originally created by
[Francis Irving](http://www.flourish.org/) and [Julian Todd](http://www.goatchurch.org.uk/) in 2003. We owe Julian and Francis a massive debt of gratitude for everything they've done.

A huge thank you to [Google Australia](http://www.google.com.au) whose donation in 2013 made the initial development of this project possible.
