      About Working Title
      ===================

      In Australia we elect individuals to represent us in Parliament. These people, our Members of Parliament, are then supposed to vote in our interest and pass legislation to create the society we want. Our media gives enormous space to these members to talk about and sell their positions—but do you know how the individual speaking for your electorate actually votes? Do they ever cross the floor to vote against their party for the interests and beliefs of people in your electorate?

      This website, Public Whip, creates a simple record of how every member of Federal Parliament votes in every recorded division (“Division” is the fancy parliamentary term for <em>vote in parliament</em>). Looking for the member who represents you? It’s easy to #{link_to "get started by searching", search_path()} or head to the full list of #{link_to "Senators", members_path(house: "senate")} and #{link_to "Representatives", members_path(house: "representatives")}.

      A lot of what happens in parliament is pretty confusing and full of stuffy jargon. People like you are using Public Whip to discuss and summarise many of the divisions and explain how they are related to specific policy positions. That means that you don’t have to speak archaic, parliamentary language to understand if a member votes #{link_to "for expanding powers to intercept communications", policy_path(44)} or #{link_to "for Aboriginal land rights", policy_path(24)} as an exmample. There is a whole #{link_to "list of policies", policies_path}, which you could even add to.

      ## Who made this?

      Public Whip is a non-partisan, open source project by the OpenAustralia Foundation, a not-for-profit, independent organisation that builds websites like this to help you keep tabs on your government.

      The OpenAustralian Foundation has ported this project from the [UK Public Whip project](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/) created by [Francis Irving](http://www.flourish.org/) and [Julian Todd](http://www.goatchurch.org.uk/) in 2003.

      ## Where do the records come from?

      Debate transcripts of the House of Representatives and the Senate are published online as #{link_to "Hansard", "http://www.openaustralia.org/"}. Public Whip takes these records and compiles lists of votes that you can access under #{link_to "Divisions", divisions_path}. You can search through these votes using our #{link_to "search function", root_path} on the home page or you can browse the votes that are relevant to the particular policy areas listed under #{link_to "Policies", policies_path} (for more on our policies, see #{link_to "What are Policies and how do they work?", "#policies"}).

      The Public Whip’s voting and membership data extends back to 2006. New divisions are added as soon as possible after becoming available. We give no warranty for the data so let us know if you find any factual inaccuracies.
