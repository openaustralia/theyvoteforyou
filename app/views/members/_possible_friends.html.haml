    Compare

  %p
    Shows people in order of those who voted always the same as
    = person.name
    (100% agreement) to those who never voted the same (0% agreement).
  %p
    We only compare those votes where both people attended.

    This may reveal relationships between people that were previously unsuspected. Or it may be nonsense.
