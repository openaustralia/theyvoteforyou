    This division is yet to be summarised. Believe it or not, but there is no easy to understand explanation of every vote in our parliament.
    If you’d like to know more about this division, reading the #{link_to "proceeding debate"} may be helpful. You can help everybody by improving this resource—#{link_to "provide a summary of what was voted on in this division.", edit_division_path(division)}
