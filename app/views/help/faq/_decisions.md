<%= Settings.project_name %> is concerned with the voting patterns of politicians, which means it is limited to
formal votes (known as divisions, see [What is a division?](#division)). This is because
politicians’ names and how they voted are only recorded in the official record of Parliament
(known as the Hansard) when a division occurs.

Unfortunately, most decisions in Parliament are not made by division
(see [When does a division occur?](#division-occur)) and so do not appear on this site.
