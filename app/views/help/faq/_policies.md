On <%= Settings.project_name %>, the [Policies](/policies) are sets of votes on an issue.

We choose and develop particular Policies for a number of reasons. For example, we prioritise
issues where politicians have rebelled
(e.g. the [local government recognition divisions](/policies/10))
or where parties have allowed their members to take a free vote
(e.g. the [same sex marriage divisions](/policies/1))
because these divisions give a strong indication of an individual politician’s voting patterns
(see [What are “Rebel Voters”?](#rebel) and [What is a “Free Vote”?](#free)).
Other reasons for selecting a particular Policy include whether the matter was an election issue
(e.g. the [carbon price](/policies/3)) and whether there was a high level of attendance
(see [What do the “attendance” figures mean?](#attendance) and
[What do the “rebellion” figures mean?](#rebellion)).

Unfortunately, Policies are restricted to issues that are voted on by division because those are
the only decisions that appear on <%= Settings.project_name %>
(see [Why don’t all decisions made in Parliament appear on <%= Settings.project_name %>?](#decisions))
