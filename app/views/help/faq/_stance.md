They Vote For You uses rankings like 'strongly' and 'very strongly' to take account of the fact that while our MPs and Senators can only vote Yes or No in any given [division](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/divisions) (or formal vote), there are several divisions connected to each [policy](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/policies) and not all those divisions have the same significance. So, when you connect a division to a policy, you have to select how someone who supported that policy would vote. The options are:  

* Yes (Strong)
* Yes
* No (Strong)
* No

We give the strength option as a way to distinguish between important and less important votes. For example, for our [marriage equality policy](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/policies/1), a vote to pass a bill that would legalise same-sex marriage is clearly an important vote and so worth the "strong" marker. But a vote on recognising that it's the National Year of Action on Marriage Equality is less important since it doesn't actually change anything and is simply an awareness raising exercise. Both these votes relate to the policy and so have been connected to it, but with different levels of significance.

For an MP or Senator to be marked as "voted very strongly for" a particular policy, they need to have almost always voted in a way that supports the policy (they may have voted against it once or twice, but usually only in a less important vote) and they need to have been present for almost every vote (too many absences will count against them and may even push them into the "voted against" categories since in our Parliament, not voting ultimately has the same effect as voting against something).

If you click into one of your [representatives' voting cards](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people) and click on a particular policy, we have an explanation of exactly how their voting position is worked out near the bottom of the page. For example, see how Senator Penny Wong [votes on marriage equality](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/senate/sa/penny_wong/policies/1) and scroll down to the heading "How "voted moderately for" is worked out".
