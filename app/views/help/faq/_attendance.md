"Attendence" figure describes the amount of times a representative has attended the Chamber as a percentage.
	
Where 100% attendence means the representative has not missed a single parlimentary sitting.

There are several reasons why a politician may have low attendance figures. For example, they may have abstained, have ministerial or other duties or they may be the speaker.

We have no way of telling the difference between someone that was not in parliament on the day, was busy with other duties in parliament and someone who actively abstained because this is not officially recorded anywhere. In future when this is recorded we will show it to you.
