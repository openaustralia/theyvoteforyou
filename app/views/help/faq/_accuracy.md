They Vote For You gets its voting data from the official record, which means it’s possible to double
check everything you see by comparing it to the [official parliamentary website](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard) – in fact, we encourage
you to do so! We are a small team and greatly appreciate any help we receive to make sure that They
Vote For You is as accurate and reliable as possible.

### How accurate are our policies?

Every policy provides a short description of what the policy represents as well as a list of every
attached division. These divisions all have a plain English explanation of what was voted on, as well
as links to a copy of the Hansard and, if it is a division on a bill, a link to the bill homepage.

You can read each division explanation and decide for yourself whether it is truly related to the policy
you’re investigating, and whether it has been attached to the policy correctly. For example, perhaps it
has been mistakenly attached to the policy so that someone who votes “Yes” is described as supporting the
policy, when in truth it should be opposite (that is, a supporter would have voted “No”).

If you do find any errors like this, please let us know so we can correct the record as soon as possible.

Every policy is a work in progress. As new divisions come in, policy descriptions may change. We always
welcome feedback on our policies and advice on how they may be improved.

### How accurate are our divisions?

Each division page includes a plain English explanation of what was voted on, as well as links to a copy
of the Hansard and, if it is a division on a bill, a link to the bill homepage. They also include the date
and time of the vote and indicate whether it took place in the House of Representatives or the Senate.

You can take note of this information and then go to [Votes and Proceedings](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/HoR/Votes_and_Proceedings) (for the House of
Representatives) or [Journals of the Senate](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Senate_chamber_documents/Journals_of_the_Senate) (for the Senate) and find the original record for the division.
You can also look at the Hansard itself (for both the [House of Representatives](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansreps_2011) and the [Senate](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hanssen261110)) if you wish
to see both the division record and a full transcript of the discussion surrounding it.

If you believe that the official record does not match the record on They Vote For You, please let us know
so that we can investigate and, if required, correct the record.
