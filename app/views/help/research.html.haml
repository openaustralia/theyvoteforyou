%h1 Parliamentary Research
%h2 Introduction

%p
  Many people use #{Settings.project_name} to research their area of special
  interest and understand what Parliament is doing. We want to make
  it possible for everyone to share the workload of decoding the
  jargon and summarising the documents. Just being able to help one
  another to find necessary information will be a major step
  forward.

%h2 Commenting on debates
%p
  Over at
  = link_to "TheyWorkForYou.com", "http://www.theyworkforyou.com"
  (there is a
  direct link from every division page) you can post your comments
  against speeches in the Parliamentary debates. This is a good way
  to highlight important facts or add information that may have been
  left out of the official discussion.

%h2 Division description editing
%p
  When the system uploads a new Parliamentary division, it prints
  the following statement above the words:

%blockquote
  Description automatically extracted from the debate,
  please edit it to make it better.

%p
  While
  = link_to "TheyWorkForYou.com", "http://www.theyworkforyou.com"
  helps to
  make the debates more friendly, it doesn't make the motions more
  readable, and our computer program often guesses it wrong. Not only
  that, even when it gets it right, the accurate text uses too much
  Parliamentary jargon and refers to other documents by page and line
  number where it would better be served by a hyperlink. This is
  particularly true for legislation.
%p
  #{Settings.project_name} allows anyone to write a plain english version of
  the motion, with links to explanations and relevant document.
%p
  We are looking for people who are passionate about issues in
  Parliament that have been subject to frequent, repeated votes by
  MPs. It could be immigration, education, the environment,
  transport, international development, and so on. Find these
  divisions, mark them with a Policy, and fix the division
  descriptions so that other people can see the precise meaning of
  what was voted upon. #{Settings.project_name} is about making an informed choice
  based on the definitive record, and not having to take anyone's
  word for things.

%h2 Examples of division description editing
%p
  The first example is
  #{link_to "Council Tax - 2 Mar 2005 - Division No. 110", "http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2005-03-02&number=110"},
  which is an
  opposition motion. These have a simple structure, but even so
  wording and formatting changes make the effect of the motion much
  clearer. The crucial thing it that it should be easier to tell what
  Aye and No mean.

          above-inflation rises planned in the forthcoming year and after the
          general election; expresses concern that pensioners have been hit
          hardest and calls on the Government to implement the Conservative
          policy of an automatic council tax discount for those aged 65 and
          over; notes with alarm the Government's plans in any third term for
          a revaluation which would lead to greater inequities and new higher
          council tax bands; rejects Liberal Democrat plans for a local
          income tax, regional income tax and higher national income tax; and
          calls for less bureaucracy and interference from Whitehall and
          regional bureaucrats in local government funding and for greater

%h2 Guidelines for editing the description of divisions

%ul.motionguidelines
  %li
    Avoid Parliamentary jargon. Phrases like "Question Put", "I beg
    to move", and "Third Reading" should not be used unless
    explained.
  %li
    Make it clear which side won the vote so people don't need to
    read the numbers to discover the result. When they do look at the
    vote chart after reading the division description, they should
    already know what the Ayes and Noes mean.
  %li
    Whenever there is an amendment to a motion, both the original
    motion and the amended motion should be listed, never the amendment
    which is meaningless on its own.
  %li
    Include all possible hyper-links. Parliamentary motions can
    mention Departmental Reports, Command Papers, UN resolutions, items
    in the news, and past statements or votes in the House. Track
    everything down using Google and make links to them so that people
    who don't know these source documents exist can find them.
    Political statements must at no time be more than one click away
    from the facts that support or dispute it.
  %li
    If there is a vote to pass a Statutory Instrument, link to the
    Statutory Instrument and the Statute. Votes to change the
    Parliamentary Standing Orders should link to both versions of the
    Standing Order and provide an explanation and examples. However,
    not every mention of a Standing Order needs to be linked if it's
    the Speaker reading them out to justify what going to happen
    next.
  %li
    A division on a piece of legislation must have the full and
    correct name of the Bill in the title followed by a dash "--" and
    any further qualifiers: "Money Resolution", "Second Reading",
    "Programme Motion", etc.
  %li
    The reason for these qualifiers in a legislation division is to
    put the vote in its place within the standard procedural plot.
    Links to the next unit (eg the Standing Committee page) and the
    preceding unit of the plot is also desirable.
  %li
    You must endeavor to link to the correct version of the Bill.
    There can be several and you must carefully examine the titles and
    the dates to be sure to get them right. The links to them are often
    broken, but the pages can be found by searching for the title in
    quotes plus site:parliament.uk in Google.
  %li
    When a clause or set of clauses are agreed to, link to them
    directly and summarize their meaning if possible. Interpret the
    meaning as best you can, and if you can't fully understand it, say
    so. If a clause amends another Act that is online, then link
    directly to that part of the Act that has been changed. In the
    future we will be able to create back-links. The word "clause" and
    "section" are sometimes used interchangeably.
  %li
    Amendments to clauses are the hardest part of the job. You have
    to read the top and the bottom of the debate relating to the
    division very carefully. When the Speaker says: "With this it will
    be convenient to discuss the following Amendments" he's telling you
    the subject of the debate, not the meaning of the division. The
    division only applies to what the MP said in the phrase: "I beg to
    move". However, some of the amendments the speaker lists may need
    to be considered because the amendment that was moved is incomplete
    on its own. This is because each contiguous change in the text is a
    separate amendment. It's sometimes possible to find a webpage
    listing all the amendments.
  %li
    Watch out for the phrase "Amendment by leave withdrawn" just
    before the division is called, or you will put in the wrong text.
    Sometimes the Speaker restates the amendment before or after the
    division, but many times not. Watch out for negations: "That the
    original words of the clause stand part" versus "That the amendment
    be made."
  %li
    Once you have started working through the votes on a Bill,
    stick to it. It can take as long as an hour to piece together the
    meaning of a division in the worst case. Fortunately, they don't
    vote on the most boring parts of the Bill, so you don't need to
    analyze them. However, it's a good idea to page through the full
    text of a Bill to get a feel for its content. Once you get to know
    it a little bit you'll be best placed to finish it off, so do
    so.
  %li
    As well as making the division description as clear, readable
    and honest as possible so that people can decide how they feel
    about the MPs who voted for or against it, leave it in a state that
    gives those who want to do further research a head start. If you
    spent an hour working out a motion, think of it as saving an hour
    of someone else's time, which means they will be able to do
    research that would otherwise not have been possible. For example,
    newspaper reporters need to get to creditable facts quickly. You
    may have given them a channel into the heart of the process which
    means they don't have to rely on a self-serving Government press
    notice to track down the news.
  %li
    Division description editors are independent of Parliament,
    which means we can be critical of its process in the way that
    anyone in the system is unwilling or unable to be. But check up on
    each other's work whenever you can.
  %li
    We have experienced little use and no actual signs of abuse.
    Until we experience abuse, we cannot make provisions for it. In
    practice, wikis experience surprisingly little abuse, probably
    because it's usually obvious and there are more people prepared to
    erase the abuse than create it. There's always the chance that a
    party may try to hijack this outlet as they do so many political
    happening. However it's unlikely because it could too easily be
    found out and backfire.
  %li
    To prevent us (Francis and Julian) from abusing PublicWhip, we
    have released all the code under the General Public License. We
    would also like to establish a public repository for all the Policy
    and Motion Text information so that we can't be accused of owning
    the information. The safeguard is that anyone with the right skills
    can download and establish a rival version of PublicWhip (under
    another domain name) in case we get lazy, sell out, or run into
    some sort of legal hassle. We must ensure that it can live on by
    disabling our ability to abolish it.
