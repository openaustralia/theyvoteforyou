    %p Please name your policy, and give a definition.

    Here you have to name and describe the policy. Afterwards, you
    will be able to select which votes support the policy. The new
    policy can represent anything you like. Some examples:
  %ul
    %li Equal laws for heterosexuals and homosexuals.
    %li For offshore processing of arrivals by boat.
    %li Pro-nuclear power.
  %p
    All policies are public. Just because you made a policy does not
    mean you own it. Anybody can edit it. Although everyone will by no
    means agree with every policy, they should agree that its votes in
    divisions are logical consequences of its definition.
  %p Some other things to note about policies:
  %ul
    %li
      Policies should be open to as little interpretation as
      possible. For example, "Evangelical Christian" and "Fiscal
      Responsibility" are not policies since there are differing opinions
      about what would be implemented. Instead, things like "Ban research
      using embryos" and "Buy more nuclear weapons" are policies because,
      even if you don't agree with them, you can still agree on which way
      they would vote.
    %li
      Usually a policy can't be broken down into other policies. If
      it can be, maybe you should split it into two sub-policies. There
      are exceptions, for example "Pro-vegetarianism" may agree with all
      the votes for "Conserve coastal fish stocks" although for quite
      different reasons.
    %li
      The opposite of a policy is not necessarily a policy,
      particularly if it is not one of the extremes. There could be, for
      instance, three different approaches to solving a particular
      problem.
    / TODO: Provide a specific Australian example
    %li
      All policies must be convertable into votes. So, for example,
      "Make Australia a Republic" doesn't work because there haven't been
      any such votes (recently).
    %li
      Don't be shy. These policies belong to everyone. If you have a
      point of view that a policy is wrongly voting, or it's ill-defined,
      or you can see how it should be broken down, discuss it with others
      and fix it.
