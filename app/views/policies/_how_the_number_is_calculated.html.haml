      How "never voted" is worked out

    %p
      Normally a person's votes count towards a score which is used to work out a simple
      phrase to summarise their position on a policy. However in this case
      = policy_person_distance.person.name
      was absent during all divisions for this policy. So, it's impossible to say anything concrete other
      than that they have "never voted" on this policy.
  - else
    %h2
      How
      "#{policy_agreement_summary(policy_person_distance)}"
      is worked out

    %p
      The MP's votes count towards a weighted average where the most important votes get
      #{pluralize(Distance.possible_points[:samestrong], "point")},
      less important votes get
      #{pluralize(Distance.possible_points[:same], "point")},
      and less important votes for which the MP was absent get
      #{pluralize(Distance.possible_points[:absent], "point")}.
      In important votes the MP gets awarded the full
      = pluralize(Distance.points[:samestrong], "point")
      for voting the same as the policy,
      = pluralize(Distance.points[:differstrong], "point")
      for voting against the policy, and
      = pluralize(Distance.points[:absentstrong], "point")
      for not voting. In less important votes, the MP gets
      = pluralize(Distance.points[:same], "point")
      for voting with the policy,
      = pluralize(Distance.points[:differ], "point")
      for voting against, and
      = Distance.points[:absent]
      (out of #{Distance.possible_points[:absent]})
      if absent.

    %p
      Then, the number gets converted to a simple english language phrase based on the range of values it's within.

              *Pressure of other work means MPs or
              Senators are not always available to vote – it does not always
              indicate they have abstained. Therefore, being absent on a less
              important vote makes a disproportionatly small
              difference.
