%h2#ratioexpl How the number is calculated

%p
  The MP's votes count towards a weighted average where the most important votes get
  #{pluralize(Distance.possible_points[:samestrong], "point")},
  less important votes get
  #{pluralize(Distance.possible_points[:same], "point")},
  and less important votes for which the MP was absent get
  #{pluralize(Distance.possible_points[:absent], "point")}.
  In important votes the MP gets awarded the full
  = pluralize(Distance.points[:samestrong], "point")
  for voting the same as the policy,
  = pluralize(Distance.points[:differstrong], "point")
  for voting against the policy, and
  = pluralize(Distance.points[:absentstrong], "point")
  for not voting. In less important votes, the MP gets
  = pluralize(Distance.points[:same], "point")
  for voting with the policy,
  = pluralize(Distance.points[:differ], "point")
  for voting against, and
  = Distance.points[:absent]
  (out of #{Distance.possible_points[:absent]})
  if absent.

          *Pressure of other work means MPs or
          Senators are not always available to vote – it does not always
          indicate they have abstained. Therefore, being absent on a less
          important vote makes a disproportionatly small
          difference.
