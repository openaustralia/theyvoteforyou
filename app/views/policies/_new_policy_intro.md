Here you have to name and describe the policy. Afterwards, you
will be able to select which votes support the policy. The new
policy can represent anything you like.

All policies are public. Just because you made a policy does not
mean you own it. Anybody can edit it. Although everyone will by no
means agree with every policy, they should agree that its votes in
divisions are logical consequences of its definition.

Some other things to note about policies:

* Policies should be open to as little interpretation as
  possible. For example, "Evangelical Christian" and "Fiscal
  Responsibility" are not policies since there are differing opinions
  about what would be implemented. Instead, things like "Ban research
  using embryos" and "Buy more nuclear weapons" are policies because,
  even if you don't agree with them, you can still agree on which way
  they would vote.
* Usually a policy can't be broken down into other policies. If
  it can be, maybe you should split it into two sub-policies. There
  are exceptions, for example "Pro-vegetarianism" may agree with all
  the votes for "Conserve coastal fish stocks" although for quite
  different reasons.
* The opposite of a policy is not necessarily a policy,
  particularly if it is not one of the extremes. There could be, for
  instance, three different approaches to solving a particular
  problem.
* All policies must be convertable into votes. So, for example,
  "Make Australia a Republic" doesn't work because there haven't been
  any such votes (recently).
* Don't be shy. These policies belong to everyone.
  If you believe that a policy is wrongly voting on divisions or is ill-defined, fix it.
