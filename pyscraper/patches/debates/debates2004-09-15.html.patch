 he was put where the fox happened to be when he went out with the Worcestershire hounds, but I suspect that that happened by pure chance. Foxes are wild creatures that do not necessarily run over the same places. However, a drag hunt requires a trail to be laid over specific land. Many farmers will not allow drag hunts to go over their land because of the damage to land that they can cause. Fox hunts can damage land, but farmers allow them to take place because they control foxes.

 <p><b>Mr Andrew Robathan (Blaby):</b>  I know that my hon. Friend has a farm, and that he was a farmer before coming to the House. I too have a farm. We heard the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Foster) talking about the "round Worcester" ride. I want foxes to be kept down, but I do not want my land to be torn up by hundreds of yahoo, tally-ho types riding across it. I do not want my land to be a pleasure ground for people on horses.
 
 <p><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> My hon. Friend is right. The hon. Member for Worcester went out hunting once and thinks he knows all about it. He quoted from his local newspaper, saying that the summer ride of the Warwickshire hunt would be an alternative to fox hunting. That shows how little he knows about fox hunting. For years, most hunts have used these summer rides as a means of raising money, or as an activity at a time of year when there is no fox hunting. I wish that Opposition Members would check their facts before speaking on the subject. Nothing annoys my constituents more than Opposition Members talking about fox hunting when they know nothing about it.</p>
