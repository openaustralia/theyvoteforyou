# Public Whip [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/openaustralia/publicwhip.png?label=ready)](https://waffle.io/openaustralia/publicwhip)

This is an Australian fork of the UK website [Public Whip](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/).

We're currently porting the codebase to Rails - see the `rails` directory.
During development both the original PHP code and the Rails port need to be run
side by side to in order to compare them.

The easiest way to get a development environment set up is to use [vagrant][1]
and [virtualbox][2] to bring up a virtual machine. Once you've got them
installed and have the publicwhip source code, `cd` into the source code
directory and run `vagrant up`. This will download the base virtualbox image
and set up the development environment, be prepared for a bit of a wait.

Once that's done, you'll find the original PHP app available at localhost:8080
(vagrant will automatically forward the port from the VM to the host). Run the
rspec tests from inside the VM like this:

* `vagrant ssh`
* `cd /vagrant/rails`
* `bundle exec rake PHP_SERVER=localhost`

Assuming they pass, you can start the rails server:

* `bundle exec rails server`

Once it is up you can browse to localhost:3000 on the host.

If vagrant reports that it can't mount the `/vagrant` virtualbox shared folder,
it's becuase the VM has had it's kernel updated. Run
`vagrant provision && vagrant reload` and you should be back in business.
